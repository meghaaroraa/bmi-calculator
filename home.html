    <h1>Welcome to the BMI Calculator</h1>
    <p>
        BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It is a numerical value calculated based on a person's weight 
        and height and is commonly used as an indicator of body fatness and potential health risks 
        associated with weight. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the 
        square of their height in meters (BMI = weight in kg / (height in meters)^2). The resulting 
        value is then used to categorize individuals into different BMI ranges, such as underweight, 
        normal weight, overweight, and obese, providing a general assessment of their weight status and 
        potential health implications.
